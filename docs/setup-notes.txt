One-shot command to update hpm to the latest git tree and restart:
cd ~/hpm && date && git pull && bash ./build.sh && sudo sh -c $HOME/hpm/scripts/update-hpm-executable.sh

Read all connected sensors data in one go:
time ls /sys/bus/w1/devices | grep 28- | awk '{print "/sys/bus/w1/devices/" $1 "/w1_slave";}' | xargs cat

List all connected temp sensors:
ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/2* -dl

Manually send daemon USR1 signal:
sudo hpm-reload


On DS18B20 resolution:

As seen here: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/w1/slaves/w1_therm

"
Writing a value between 9 and 12 to the sysfs w1_slave file will change the
precision of the sensor for the next readings. This value is in (volatile)
SRAM, so it is reset when the sensor gets power-cycled.

To store the current precision configuration into EEPROM, the value 0
has to be written to the sysfs w1_slave file. Since the EEPROM has a limited
amount of writes (>50k), this command should be used wisely.

Get all connected temp sensors resolution:
cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-*/resolution

To setup a specific DS18B20 temp sensor resolution as default between power cycling:
# to set resolution:
sudo sh -c "echo 9 >/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-0315549b98ff/w1_slave"
# to write resolution as default (write to EEPROM):
sudo sh -c "echo 0 >/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-0315549b98ff/w1_slave"

sudo sh -c "echo 9 >/sys/bus/w1/devices//w1_slave"
sudo sh -c "echo 0 >/sys/bus/w1/devices//w1_slave"
